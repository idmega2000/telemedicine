			Brain and nervous system problems are common. Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor & other diseases that involve the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. The first signs are trouble thinking and having difficulty with moving and motor coordination. Other patients can be suffering from neurodegenerative diseases where cells in the brain start dying after stroke or with age.
